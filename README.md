Gakken GMC-4 Simulator
======================
This is a program that simulates the process in a board of 4-bit microprocessor GMC-4
provided by Gakken (http://otonanokagaku.net/magazine/vol24/index.html).
This also includes an assembler, disassembler and a simple
assembler editor so that you can develop a program for that processor.
